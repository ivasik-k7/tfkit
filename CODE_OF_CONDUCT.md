# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of TFKit pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity, gender expression, experience level, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful environment for collaboration, learning, and growth in infrastructure automation and Terraform analysis.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing gratitude for others’ contributions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed unacceptable.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, documentation) and in public spaces where an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at **ivan.kovtun@bayer.com** or by opening a private discussion in the repository.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines when addressing violations:

1. **Correction** – Private, written warning with clear guidance.
2. **Warning** – Continued infractions result in a temporary restriction from participation.
3. **Suspension** – Temporary ban from project spaces for severe or repeated violations.
4. **Expulsion** – Permanent ban for egregious or repeated misconduct.
